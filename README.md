# MakersBnb Project

## Project Specifications 

A web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night.

### To test it out:
```
1. clone repo
2. cd into directory 
3. run bundle to make sure all gems are in place
4. run rackup to initiate server
4. see application on http://localhost:9292/
```

### MVP

As a user so I can see my space, I want to be able to add my space with description, and see a list of all current spaces.

## Our approach
- Initially, we decided our working practises.  This consisted of how we would schedule things such as morning stand-ups, retros, splitting the workload and what to do if anyone had issues.

## Team Successes
- We managed to successfully split the workload via branching so that code wasn't overwritten
- We kept to our schedule
